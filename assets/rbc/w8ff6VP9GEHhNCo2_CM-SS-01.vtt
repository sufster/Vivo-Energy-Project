00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.810
<v ->What are your greatest strengths?</v>

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.560
It's a big question.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.160
And for many of us, it's not always easy to answer.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.670
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint where we stand out.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.880
So how can you gain some clarity?

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.880
First, let's look at the benefits of assessing

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.523
and leveraging your strengths.

8
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.050
By taking the time to understand your strengths,

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.480
you take the time to understand yourself.

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.310
And that leads to several benefits.

11
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.440
First, it fosters a fulfilling career.

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.690
If you go down a path of weakness,

13
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.300
your job will feel like an uphill battle.

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.510
Understand your strengths, however,

15
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.180
and you can work with those abilities

16
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.993
and achieve greater success.

17
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.210
Second, knowing your strengths increases confidence.

18
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.140
Instead of getting frustrated about what you can't do,

19
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.263
you'll come to appreciate what you can do.

20
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.480
Third, it promotes greater engagement.

21
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.020
By playing to your strengths,

22
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.850
your time will yield greater rewards.

23
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.410
And that increases your sense of happiness

24
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.113
and workplace wellbeing.

25
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.350
Finally, it improves your performance.

26
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.030
After all, high performers aren't void of weakness.

27
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.730
What sets them apart is that they use their strengths

28
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.033
rather than their shortcomings to propel their work.

29
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.280
So how can you uncover your strengths?

30
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.730
It starts with some self reflection.

31
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.960
You'll need to consider how you see yourself

32
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.963
as well as how others see you.

33
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.010
To discover your strengths, answer five questions.

34
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.380
First, what do you know?

35
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.720
Reflect on what you've learned thus far in your career.

36
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.190
Consider your education, training, and work experience.

37
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.850
Second, where have you excelled?

38
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.790
What are some of your biggest wins

39
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.000
and what strengths helped you get there?

40
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.260
For example, maybe you're creative

41
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.520
which once helped you devise an original

42
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.410
wildly successful campaign idea.

43
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.510
Third, what comes naturally?

44
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.950
Consider where you feel the least amount of friction

45
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.770
to get started, or to keep going.

46
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.100
What tasks just seem to flow smoothly

47
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.793
and promote an "I've got this" attitude?

48
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.410
Now that you've looked inward,

49
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.320
let's move on to the final two questions.

50
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.023
Paying close attention to what separates you from the pack.

51
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.850
The fourth question to ask, what separates you from others?

52
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.270
In a room full of people,

53
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.310
how do you tend to shine the brightest?

54
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.060
For example, are you known for being especially speedy,

55
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.070
but also accurate?

56
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.730
Finally, how do others see you?

57
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.510
Think about the feedback you've received in the past.

58
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.150
What strengths have your managers and colleagues mentioned?

59
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.360
Also, consider what favors others tend to ask of you.

60
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.330
For example, maybe you're the one people come to

61
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.053
for design tips, research advice, or tech knowledge.

62
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.130
Your strengths are what make you stand out.

63
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.870
Once you understand them, you can then leverage them

64
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.510
to your advantage.

65
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.720
So how's that done?

66
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.080
To leverage your strengths,

67
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.470
concentrate on two areas.

68
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.563
First, reflect on what you're currently doing.

69
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.760
At the end of each workday, ask yourself,

70
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.830
what strengths did I use today?

71
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.520
How did I use them?

72
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.320
And what are some missed opportunities.

73
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.193
Be specific as you consider what's working and what isn't.

74
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.080
Then consider how you can redesign your habits

75
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.223
to utilize and build on your top talents.

76
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.520
Ask yourself, based on my reflections,

77
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.350
what should I do more of?

78
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.000
And how can I better play to my strengths?

79
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.830
The actions you take don't need to be revolutionary.

80
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.090
The trick is to seek the opportunities you need

81
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.880
rather than hoping they fall into your lap.

82
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.810
That will allow you to use those strengths

83
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.793
and further nurture your skills.

84
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.920
Your strengths give insight into who you are as a person.

85
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.870
By taking the time to understand and leverage them,

86
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.220
you can create a more fulfilling and rewarding career.

87
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.750
So, commit to the self reflection

88
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.680
and continue to redesign your habits.

89
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.890
That way, you can practice, improve,

90
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.323
and leverage your strengths to your advantage.
